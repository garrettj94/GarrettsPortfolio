        Welcome! My name is Garrett Jackson. I stated my coding journey just after turning 28 while I was talking with a friend trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my future. I have been in the insurance industry for the last 7 years but I knew I needed a change. He mentioned that I should look into coding since I have always loved gaming and being on a computer. This conversation started a spark in me that I never knew excited. I dove head first into coding and for the first time in my life i found my calling. I hope to one day take what I have learned and will continue to learn and move into game development. I hope you like what you see!
